## Documentation for Business Card

For this business card, I decided to start with an icon that I had created for another class, which was eyes with glasses. My glasses are a big part of my identity and physical appearance and made sense as a logo for me. I also wanted to showcase my illustration work as well. I chose I piece that was from this school year that I felt was a good representation of my art. I love using pinks, blues and purples in my art and I wanted the business card to match the art in the background. I used the deep purple for the main color because purple being my favorite color is another thing that is a big part of my identity as a person. I then used the light blue for the background of the card, and then the majenta as an accent color.
